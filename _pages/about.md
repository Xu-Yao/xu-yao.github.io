About Me
======
I am a Senior Research Scientist at [Flawless](https://www.flawlessai.com/) working on generative AI technologies for visual dubbing. Prior to this, I was a Cifre PhD researcher at [InterDigtial R&D](https://www.interdigital.com/research-and-innovation) working on deep learning algorithms for face editing in 4K movies. I obtained my Ph.D. from [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home) in 2022. I received my M.Sc. from [Mines Paris](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/en/home/) and my B.Sc from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/).

My research interests lie in the general area of image and video synthesis, generative modeling, diffusion models and latent space interpretation. My [PhD thesis](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-03788218) was on face editing in high resolution videos using deep learning methods.

<!-- I am a Ph.D. student in the [Image, Data and Signal Department](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/the-school/teaching-research-departments/image-data-signal) at [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home). My research interests lie in the general area of image processing, particularly in deep learning, generative modeling, latent space interpretation and image-to-image translation problems.

Before I received my Master of Science and Executive Engineering Degree from [Mines ParisTech](http://www.mines-paristech.fr/) and my Bachelor of Science Degree from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/). -->
