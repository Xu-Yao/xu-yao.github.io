About Me
======
I am a Ph.D. student in the [Image, Data and Signal Department](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/the-school/teaching-research-departments/image-data-signal) at [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home). My research interests lie in the general area of image processing, particularly in deep learning, generative modeling, latent space interpretation and image-to-image translation problems.

Before I received my Master of Science and Executive Engineering Degree from [Mines ParisTech](http://www.mines-paristech.fr/) and my Bachelor of Science Degree from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/).
